Hereâ€™s an explanation of the column headings:

* `id`: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover
* `terrestrial_date`: the date on Earth
* `sol`: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars
* `ls`: the solar longitude
* `month`: the Martian month
* `min_temp`: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)
* `pressure`: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location


On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. 
But it is always very cold there in human terms!

Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.

The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. 
A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. 
Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
